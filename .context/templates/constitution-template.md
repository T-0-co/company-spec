## Part 2: Capture Principles

*These principles govern how knowledge is captured and maintained throughout this engagement.*

### Article I: Source Attribution

Every artifact must cite its authoritative source or knowledge holder. Include:

- Source type (document, interview, system export, observation)
- Source identifier (document name, interviewee, system name)
- Date of capture

### Article II: Currency Tracking

All artifacts must include:

- Last-verified date
- Owner responsible for updates
- Review frequency (quarterly, annually, on-change)

### Article III: Completeness Over Perfection

Capture "good enough" knowledge quickly; refine iteratively based on AI usage feedback. An 80% complete artifact today is better than a 100% complete artifact never delivered.

### Article IV: Context Preservation

Document the "why" behind processes and decisions, not just the "what." Include:

- Historical context where relevant
- Rationale for current practices
- Known exceptions and their reasons

### Article V: Validation Required

No artifact is complete until validated by a subject matter expert. Validation includes:

- Accuracy check (is this factually correct?)
- Completeness check (are critical elements missing?)
- Currency check (is this still true?)

### Article VI: [CUSTOM_PRINCIPLE]

[ADD_ENGAGEMENT_SPECIFIC_PRINCIPLES_AS_NEEDED]
